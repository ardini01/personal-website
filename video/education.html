						<h1>Tadika Sri Nilai</h1>
						<p>I was sent to a kindergarten which was a walking-distance from my house at age 5 years old. I do not really have much memories about it but what I remembered was that I celebrated my birthday there and I was the only one who does not wear skirts to the pre-school among the female students.</p>

						<h1>Tadika Sri Warna Sari Jaya</h1>
						<p>I moved to another kindergarten and went there by school van. It was a chinese kindergarten as I learnt chinese and had lots of chinese friends back then. The most-not-very-memorable memory I had at that pre-school was, I fainted during the assembly.</p>

						<h1>Sekolah Kebangsaan Desa Cempaka</h1>
						<p>As I was at age 7 years old, I went to primary school near with my house, around 3km distance. I went there by school bus and it was my first time using it hence why I always missed the school bus and ended up having to walk home by myself. During my UPSR year, I received straight As in all subjects.</p>
